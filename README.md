## Welcome to Esraa Khaled Website
 I am a Biomedical Engineer , at faculty of engineering Cairo University.Since my inception , I have dreamed today that I joined to Biomedical engineering department so that I can study what I love and what make me able to design a device that help me in helping patients and disabled to live their lives without pains. Now I achieved this dream and still seek to design this device that help people . I try to cope with the development of technology to harness it in favour of patients and disabled people.
